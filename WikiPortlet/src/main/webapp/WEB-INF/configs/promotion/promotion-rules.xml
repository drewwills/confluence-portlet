    It is recommended but not required to deploy your application with settings
    specific to the Development environment and overlay the files named here on
    top of them for the other environments.

    The tags are described as follows:

    environment/@name = contains files to be deployed to the named
                        environment (either Development, Test, QA or
                        Production)
    file    /name     = the name of the file in /WEB-INF/configs/promotion
    file/target       = location the file/name should be copied to.  Note
                        that there is no leading '/' character.

    The names of the files below should follow a similar convention of
        [campus]-[target environment]-[war file name]-[actual file name]
